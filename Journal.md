### Week 1

9/6/2017 

Tasks Completed:
 * Selected a project to work on
 * Reviewed SALSA STUDIO issues 
 * Created this repository 
 
I wasnt sure about what project to choose to work on, I've been taking lessons of salsa dancing and sometimes bachata, so I was experiencing the issues the SALSA
STUDIO is been having sometimes to get the right amount of people to partner up in the class, so this gave me an idea to make a project to solve this issues.


### Week 2

9/13/2017

* Wrote the problems statements
* Started documenting the project plan
* Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project

I this week I feel pretty confident to work on my project, I've been doing some resources about other guest check in application out there to have a better
idea of how my app it should look like or how it should work I will add more features that I think it will be better to have and delete or eliminate some
functions that other app out there have. so I have my project repository setup on github and IntelliJ as well.
